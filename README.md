# class-game
a videogame made by the whole class?
I added a code for room1 but I actually didn't put any actual puzzle in it which we can do later I just wanted to finish the structure of it. But I also added a getPuzzleAnswers method which i was wondering if that would make sense to add an abstract method for getPuzzleAnswers in the main room class you made.
